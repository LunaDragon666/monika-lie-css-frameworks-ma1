# CSS Frameworks
For this assignment I have chosen to work with CDN version of Bootstrap to code the supplied design into a responsive design that supports from around 375px screen size and upwards. The goal for the task was to practice creating a specific page layout we were commissioned to do, based on the XD prototype attached in this assignment, using Bootstrap and Sass. 
## Module assignment 1 
I tried to create as similar to the design as possible by using what we've learned so far, but also based on my current prerequisites. 
### Navbar
...
### Main
...
### Footer
I used the container to create equal spacing for both the footer and the navigation bar. I have deliberately excluded the footer from the "wrapper" to make it remain at the bottom of the page.
