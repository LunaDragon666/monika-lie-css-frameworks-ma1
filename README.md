# CSS Frameworks
For this assignment I have chosen to work with CDN version of Bootstrap to code the supplied design into a responsive design that supports from around 375px screen size and upwards. The goal for the task was to practice creating a specific page layout we were commissioned to do, based on the XD prototype attached in this assignment, using Bootstrap and Sass. 
## Module assignment 1 
I tried to create as similar to the design as possible by using what we've learned so far, but also based on my current prerequisites - although sass and BEM is honestly a slightly confusing concept to relate for me at the moment.
### Navbar
Basically I used CDN version of Bootstrap mostly to get a pre-built component of this navbar from the library to quickly create navigation bar layout, and from there costumize it - instead of hard-coding the nav bar (which has been a time saver for this learning project). The rest of the elements on this page is coded from scratch. The `!important` tags that follows to override the desired previous styling rules that followed to this nav, although I tried to avoid using it when possible and based on the current abilities I have to do so.
### Main
In the main content of this page, which is in this case `gridbox__container`, I used CSS Grid instead of flexbox to layout a group of square «boxes» inside the grid-layout from homepage due to its built-in facilitation to potentially create dynamic- and flexible layouts regardless of device sizes - which also makes it easier for me to keep track on them when costumizing them.
### Footer
I used the container to create equal spacing for both the footer and the navigation bar. I have deliberately excluded the footer from the "wrapper" to make it remain at the bottom of the page.
