# CSS Frameworks
For this assignment I have chosen to work with CDN version of Bootstrap to code the supplied design into a responsive design that supports from around 375px screen size and upwards. The goal for the task was to practice creating a specific page layout we were commissioned to do, based on the xd-prototype attached in this assignment, using Bootstrap and Sass.
